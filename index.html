            <p> “Hope” is the thing with feathers -<br>
                That perches in the soul -<br>
                And sings the tune without the words -
            <details>
               <summary> And never stops - at all -</summary>
                    And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br>
                    And sore must be the storm -<br>
                    That could abash the little Bird<br>
                <details> 
                    <summary>That kept so many warm -</summary>
                    I’ve heard it in the chillest land -<br>
                    And on the strangest Sea -<br>
                    Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>
                    It asked a crumb - of me.</details></p>
